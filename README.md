This repository consists of various personal side projects.

Descriptions

Sorting Visualizer - ReactJS/CSS/HTML
  - See the step by step iterations of four sorting algorithms over a array of variable size.

Sudoku Solver - Python
- Program optimizes a brute force sudoku solving algorithm. A formatted file is inputted and the algorithm produces a file with a solution as
well as several metrics pertaining to the algorithm's backtracking efficiency for the specific puzzle. Program is modularized into two components with room for a creator program to be implemented with use of the core file. 

GuitarTuner - ReactJS/CSS/HTML
- I couldn't find a decent guitar tuner online that let me change specific strings indvidually without having to use specific preset tunings. This made tuning my guitar for a song that had some funky tuning that is not that common quite difficult. Of course.. I could just have just gone to guitar center and get a tuner - but I just never made that happen:
  - This application displays individual notes per guitar string which allows for tuning with the ability to have interchangeable notes.
  - Pulled note sounds from guitar tuner database (GTDB.org)

Tracker - Python
  - Web scraping algorithm that takes COVID-19 data from Michigan.gov and displays case report per county based on user input. 
  - Made this in April and the site that was referenced has since changed. The table that I used was changed to a full blown interactive application.

Post-it Note - Python/mySQL
  - Using a mySQL database and mysqldb connector for python, the note taking program establishes a connection to a local database, and prompts a user to enter username to log into account. Program lets users add notes characterized by category into a database and displays the users notes onto console. User can delete notes based on catagory. User can also delete account, which erases correpsonding table in local database. User's data is encapsulated by personal table created for username within SQL database.

Sudoku Solver - Python
- Program optimizes a brute force sudoku solving algorithm. A formatted file is inputted, and the algorithm produces a file with a solution, as
well as several metrics pertaining to the backtracking efficiency of the algorithm for that specific puzzle. Program is modularized into two components, with room for a creator program to be implemented with use of the core file. 

GuitarTuner - ReactJS/CSS/HTML
  - Application displays individual notes per guitar string that allow for tuning with the ability to have interchangeable notes.

Tracker - Python
  - Web scraping algorithm that takes COVID-19 data from Michigan.gov and displays case report per county based on user input.

Post-it Note - Python/mySQL
  - Using a mySQL database and mysqldb connector for python, the note taking program establishes a connection to a local database, and prompts a user to enter username to log into account. Program lets users add notes characterized by category into a database and displays the users notes onto console. User can delete notes based on catagory. User can also delete account, which erases correpsonding table in local database. User's data is encapsulated by personal table created for username within SQL database.

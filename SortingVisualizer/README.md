Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This application offers a iterative visualization of four different sorting algorithms. 
User can change the size of the array, and can select from 4 algorithms.
User can see which items are being sorted at specific iteration.


Edits:
Radix sort is not complete -> need to find a way to capture each iteration when radix is sorting into buckets. 
Merge Sort is done iteratively, and is evident by its odd visualization when displayed. Need to figure out how to visualize recursive approach of algorithm (more fun).
Could speed up time it takes to iterate through depending on size of array. 
Modularize compnents into separate files (toolbar, sorting box, etc). For sake of project scope, most of the functional integration is done in a single file. 
Need to lock any further function calls until the render of a sort is complete.

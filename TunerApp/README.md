-----TUNER APP-----

This web app was created with React.

Tuner app allows users to tune a guitar by ear by mapping out each possible tune that a guitar string
can attain with repsect to their octave. Sound files are mapped from sound.json to display 
as a button that sets the state of the note component object. The note component has a button that
plays the current state. Buttons are identifed with a name, as well as a fret header, indicating to user
the scales of the sound (increasing and decreasing in pitch).
